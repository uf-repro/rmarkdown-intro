# Reproducible Documents

---

# Overview

Reproducible Documents:

* a way to write reports that embed text with other outputs:
  - code, figures, tables
* authors only make changes in *one* place
  - the entire document stays up to date
  - (instead of redoing an analysis, and copying images and numbers into a separate file)

---

# Many Platforms Exist:

* [Manubot](https://github.com/manubot/rootstock)
* [Stencila](https://stenci.la/)
* [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)

--

### This lesson is a basic intro to [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) !
(many add-ons exist that extend functionality)

# How R Markdown Works

---

# R Markdown Tools

* **`rmarkdown`** is the file-format and main interface with R (`*.Rmd`)
* **`knitr`** is the underlying engine that runs code
* `pandoc` is a software tool that converts markdown documents into other formats

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "A diagram from https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-2.html, showing the workflow for R Markdown, where an Rmd file is transformed by `knitr` into a markdown file, and then by `pandoc` into multiple output files."}
knitr::include_graphics("rmarkdownflow.png")
```

---

# Installation

* RStudio comes with `pandoc`.
  - but it can be [installed separately](https://pandoc.org/installing.html), as well.
* The **`rmarkdown`** package includes **`knitr`** as a dependency.

--

For PDF output, you will want LaTeX. The [**`tinytex`** package](https://yihui.org/tinytex/) provides a mechanism for a lightweight LaTeX install:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

---

# Creating Documents

1. Create an R Markdown document.
  - Use the `New R Markdown` file option in RStudio, or create a plaintext file.
2. Run the R code
```{r, eval = FALSE}
rmarkdown::render({document.Rmd})
```
.center[**OR**]
  Use the `Knit` button in RStudio.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "A screenshot of the Knit button in RStudio, which appears as an image of a ball of yarn with a needle in it, next to the text 'Knit' and an optional pulldown menu in the form of a down arrow."}
knitr::include_graphics("knit-button.png")
```

---
# What happens during knitting?

For a given `document.Rmd`
1. **`knitr`** runs the code chunks and merges the output with the remainder of `document.Rmd` into a markdown file: `document.md`
2. `pandoc` converts the markdown into the final outputs.

# Syntax

---
# Basic Structure

R Markdown files begin with a header:
```{yaml}
---
title: "An example document"
author: "Hao Ye"
output: html_document
---
```

* this specifies metadata about the document that gets incorporated in the final output

---
# A More Complex Header
```{yaml}
---
title: "Chaotic Dynamics"
author:
- "Hao Ye"
- "Gritty"
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_depth: 2
---
```

---

# Syntax: Headings

```
# heading 1
## heading 2
### heading 3
```
.center[*renders into*]

# heading 1
## heading 2
### heading 3

---

# Syntax: bullets

```
- bullet list
  * sub-item
1. numbered list
1. numbered list
```
.center[*renders into*]

- bullet list
  + sub-item
1. numbered list
1. numbered list

# Syntax: text

```
 **bold**, __bold__
 *italic*, _italic_
 > This is a quote.
```

# Code Chunk Options

The evaluation of code chunks can be controlled through options, e.g.:
````
```{r, eval = FALSE}`r ''`
1 + 1
```
````

```{r, eval = FALSE}

See the description of [chunk options](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/) for details.

# Other Coding Languages

**`knitr`** supports other programming languages.
See [Section 2.7](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/language-engines.html) of the R Markdown book for details.

# Tables (markdown)

```
| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
```

# Figures (code)

```{r, out.height=400, out.width = 400}
plot(mpg ~ disp, data = mtcars, 
     cex = 2, cex.lab = 2, cex.axis = 2)
```

---

# References

* Get your citations into a `.bib` format. (plain-text bibtex, most reference managers can output a list in this way)
* Add metadata to the header about the file and the *style* of citations
* Insert citations using `[@{bibentry}]`, where `{bibentry}` is the unique identifier for the reference in the bibliography.
  - see also the [`citr` add-in](https://github.com/crsh/citr).

---

# References (`.bib`)

`refs.bib`:
```
@article{Barkai_1988,
	Author = {Amos Barkai and Christopher McQuaid},
	Journal = {Science},
	Number = {4875},
	Pages = {62-64},
	Title = {Predator-prey role reversal in a marine benthic ecosystem},
	Volume = {242},
	Year = {1988}}
```

---

# References (YAML header)

```{yaml}
---
title: "An example document"
author: "Hao Ye"
output: html_document
bibliography: refs.bib
csl: methods-in-ecology-and-evolution.csl
---

---
# Other Formats

MANY packages build on R Markdown to do more complex things:
