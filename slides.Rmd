# Reproducible Documents

---

# Overview

Reproducible Documents:

* a tool to embed text with other outluts
  - code, figures, tables
* authors only make changes in *one* place
  - the entire document stays up to date
  - (instead of redoing an analysis, and copying images and numbers into MS Word)

---

# Many Platforms Exist:

* [Manubot](https://github.com/manubot/rootstock)
* [Stencila](https://stenci.la/)
* [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)

--

We are going to talk about [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) !
* many add-ons extend functionality
* *This lesson* is only a basic intro

# How R Markdown Works

---

# R Markdown Tools

* **`rmarkdown`** is the file-format and main interface with R
* **`knitr`** is the underlying engine that runs R code
* `pandoc` is a software tool that converts markdown documents into other formats

---

# Installation

* RStudio comes with `pandoc`.
  - but it can be installed separately, as well.
* The **`rmarkdown`** package includes **`knitr`** as a dependency.

--

For PDF output, you will want LaTeX. The **`tinytex`** package provides a mechanism for a lightweight LaTeX install:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

---

# Creating Documents

1. R Markdown documents are plain textCreate an R Markdown document.
2. Run the R code
```{r, eval = FALSE}
rmarkdown::render({file})
```
.center[**OR**]
  Use the `Knit` button in RStudio.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "A screenshot of the Knit button in RStudio, which appears as an image of a ball of yarn with a needle in it, next to the text 'Knit' and an optional pulldown menu in the form of a down arrow."}
knitr::include_graphics("knit-button.png")
```

---
# What happens during knitting?

For a given `document.Rmd`
1. **`knitr`** runs the code chunks and merges the output with the remainder of `document.Rmd` into a markdown file: `document.md`
2. `pandoc` converts the markdown into the final outputs.

---
# Operation

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "A diagram from https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-2.html, showing the workflow for R Markdown, where an Rmd file is transformed by `knitr` into a markdown file, and then by `pandoc` into multiple output files."}
knitr::include_graphics("rmarkdownflow.png")
```

# Syntax

---
# Basic Structure

R Markdown files begin with a header:
```{yaml}
---
title: "An example document"
author: "Hao Ye"
output: html_document
---
```

* this specifies metadata about the document that gets incorporated in the final output

---
# A More Complex Header
```{yaml}
---
title: "An example document"
author:
- "Hao Ye"
- "Gritty"
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_depth: 2
---
```

---

# Syntax: Headings

```
# heading 1
## heading 2
### heading 3
```
.center[*renders into*]

# heading 1
## heading 2
### heading 3

---

# Syntax: bullets

```
- bullet list
  * sub-item
- bullet list
```
.center[*renders into*]

- bullet list
  + sub-item
- bullet list

---

# Syntax: text

```
 **bold**, __bold__
 *italic*, _italic_
 > This is a quote.
```
.center[*renders into*]

 **bold**, __bold__
 
 *italic*, _italic_

```

---

# References

* Get your citations into a `.bib` format. (plain-text bibtex, most reference managers can output a list in this way)
* Add metadata to the header about the file and the *style* of citations
* Insert citations using correct syntax.

---

# References (`.bib`)

`refs.bib`:
```
@article{Barkai_1988,
	Author = {Amos Barkai and Christopher McQuaid},
	Journal = {Science},
	Number = {4875},
	Pages = {62-64},
	Title = {Predator-prey role reversal in a marine benthic ecosystem},
	Volume = {242},
	Year = {1988}}
```

---

# References (YAML header)

```{yaml}
---
title: "An example document"
author: "Hao Ye"
output: html_document
bibliography: refs.bib
csl: methods-in-ecology-and-evolution.csl

# Other Coding Languages

**`knitr`** supports other programming languages.
